# Server Chat:

## Introduction:
An Server Chatting App i made that you can use on your Local Wifi to communicate with Others.

## Safety:
Since i made this while i was a little bored, there may be some Safety concerning things to watch out for:
1. Simple Xoring Encryption: this is not very safe or Confidential so its more for Testing Encryption Algorithms.
2. Basic Networking Protection: Im not a high level Exploit hunter so this app may have some Bugs so dont use it Commercially (which it wouldnt either way)

## How To Build:
Windows SDK is needed for this and Visual Studio 2022 with the Basic C++ Libraries.
Build with C++ 20

## How To Use:
Should be used in Combination with: [App To Communicate with Server](https://github.com/SonnyDevInternal/Chat)
